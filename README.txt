Hello!!

This weather app allows you to see a seven day forecast of your current location

It leverages your ip address to gain the location data

After this instance it uses the open-mateo API to get weather data for that location

it will then print out the high and low temps and weather conditions (e.g. partly cloudy) for each day

Here are some resources used for this project:
